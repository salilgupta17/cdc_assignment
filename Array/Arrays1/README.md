Arrays exercises - C++ implementations

Files:
- reverse_array.cpp : Reverse an array (brute-force and in-place)
- find_min_max.cpp : Find minimum and maximum in an array
- running_sum.cpp : Running sum of 1D array
- count_max_freq.cpp : Count elements with maximum frequency
- rotate_array.cpp : Rotate array by k positions (left/right via k)
- build.ps1 : PowerShell build script to compile all .cpp files into ./bin

Usage:
Open PowerShell in this folder and run:

# Compile
.
# If g++ is available in PATH
.

# Run one of the programs
./bin/reverse_array.exe

Notes:
- Requires g++ (MinGW-w64) in PATH on Windows.
- The build script compiles each .cpp into its own executable in ./bin.
